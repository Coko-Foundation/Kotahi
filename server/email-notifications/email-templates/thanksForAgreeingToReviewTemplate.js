    <p>Thank you for agreeing to review the preprint by ${authorName} and colleagues for Biophysics Colab. I look forward to receiving your report, formatted as described below, by the agreed date. Please submit your report by completing the different fields in the review form, which you can access here; <a href="${manuscriptPageUrl}" target="_blank">${manuscriptPageUrl}</a></p>
    <p>When all the reviewers have submitted their feedback, Iâ€™ll begin to consolidate the advice into a single report that we can discuss as a reviewing group (either electronically or via a video call). You can decide whether to sign this consolidated report after it has been finalised.</p>

    <p>We respectfully ask that you treat the consolidated report as a confidential document until it is publicly associated with the preprint, and we will ask the authors to do the same.</p>

    <p>I look forward to receiving your advice.</p>

      Best regards <br />

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 2px;">Instructions for reviewers</h3>
    <p style="margin-top: 2px;">Our primary goal is to deliver objective feedback on published preprints that is independent of the criteria applied by conventional journals. Our reports detail three types of recommendation: revisions that we consider to be essential for the results to support the conclusions; optional suggestions for the authors to consider; and minor corrections or presentational issues (see below). All these recommendations should help to strengthen the manuscript, but authors can decide which advice to follow. If a revised preprint addresses the revisions that we define as essential, we offer to publicly endorse the work. <br /> <br />
      <u>General assessment</u>: <br />
      Please provide a paragraph summarising your overall assessment of the study, written for both experts and a general audience. Please mention: <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; -   	The objectives of the study <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; -   	Key findings and major conclusions <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; -   	Your opinion of its strengths and weaknesses <br /> <br />
      <u>Recommendations</u>: <br />
      Please list recommendations for improving the rigour and credibility of the work under the following three categories: <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; -   	Essential revisions <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; -   	Optional suggestions <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp; -   	Minor and presentational issues <br /> <br />
      <u>Your relevant expertise</u>: <br />
      Please succinctly state your relevant expertise (we will not reveal your name if you prefer to remain anonymous).
