          <p>
            I'm writing to tell you about a new project that I hope you’ll be interested in, and offer you an opportunity to get involved.
          </p>
          <p>
          I’m a member of the launch team for <a href="https://www.sciencecolab.org/" target="_blank">Biophysics Colab</a>, a collaboration of biophysicists working in partnership with eLife to improve how research is evaluated. Later this year, we will launch a ‘publish, review, curate’ service that will support authors to create citeable, indexed versions of their work from published preprints. Until then, we are leveraging the knowledge and expertise of the global biophysics community to provide a <b>free preprint review service</b> that provides constructive, journal-agnostic feedback to authors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We were interested to read your recent preprint “{{ manuscriptTitle }}” and would be grateful for an opportunity to review it. We would share our consolidated feedback with you at the earliest convenience, then offer you the opportunity to associate it with your preprint on bioRxiv and eLife’s <a href="https://sciety.org/groups/biophysics-colab/lists" target="_blank">Sciety</a> platform. You would be under no obligation to publicly share the report, but we hope you will choose to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your agreement to our service would not constitute submission to a journal therefore you would be at liberty to submit your paper for review elsewhere. Indeed, we realise you may have already done so, and this would not preclude your participation in our scheme. Furthermore, some authors have found that <a href="https://sciety.org/lists/ee7e738a-a1f1-465b-807c-132d273ca952" target="_blank">our public evaluations</a> have facilitated publication of their studies in traditional journals.
          </p>
          <p>
          Would you be interested in receiving expert feedback on your preprint? If so, please accept our invitation using the link below (see instructions at the foot of this message). If not, we’d be grateful if you let us know via the decline link. We’d be happy to arrange a video call if you’d like to learn more about Biophysics Colab before making a decision.

          <p>Dear {{ recipientName }}</p>

          <p>Thank you for the opportunity to review your recent preprint “{{ manuscriptTitle }}”.</p>

          <p>I’m pleased to let you know that experts in the field have now reviewed and discussed the work, and have approved a consolidated report that you can view at {{{ manuscriptLink }}}.</p>

          <p>You’ll see that we have not made any judgements about the suitability of your study for a particular journal, but have articulated its strengths and provided feedback that we believe will tighten its interpretation. I’d be happy to discuss the points we’ve raised, particularly if there’s been a misunderstanding.</p>

          <p>After considering our advice, we recommend that you take three actions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Make the report publicly available</p>
              <p>We hope you’ll agree that it will be informative for other researchers to post our consolidated report on bioRxiv and highlight your work and our feedback in our list of <a href="https://sciety.org/lists/ee7e738a-a1f1-465b-807c-132d273ca952" target="_blank">evaluated articles on Sciety</a>. You can request this using the chat function after logging in to our platform and we will arrange for the report (including the names of all signatories but excluding minor and presentational issues) to be posted at the earliest opportunity.</p>
              <p>Of course, you are under no obligation to make the report public and can instead request that it remain confidential. Please note, however, that we ask our reviewers to treat the consolidated report as a confidential document until the point of public posting, and therefore ask that you share it only with your co-authors until such a time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Post your response to the report</p>
              <p>We would naturally be happy to post your response to the reviewers’ comments alongside the consolidated report on both bioRxiv and Sciety; simply provide your response after logging in to our platform ({{{ manuscriptLink }}}) and we will post it at the first opportunity. Please use “block quote" from the drop-down styling menu to quote from our report</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Submit a revised preprint for curation</p>
              <p>We anticipate that you will want to revise your manuscript after reading our advice and encourage you to upload any revision as a revised preprint. This will provide us with an opportunity to ‘curate’ your study by posting our overall evaluation of the work, as we have outlined in the preliminary evaluation statement available at {{{ manuscriptLink }}}. If you are ready to finalise your work in this way, please log in to our platform and click on ‘Submit new version’ so that we can revise our evaluation statement appropriately and post it on bioRxiv and Sciety. If your revision addresses the essential revisions outlined in our consolidated report, we’ll add our endorsement to the evaluation and include the study in our list of <a href="https://sciety.org/lists/5ac3a439-e5c6-4b15-b109-92928a740812" target="_blank">endorsed articles on Sciety</a>.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Alternatively, if you would like further advice from our reviewing team before finalising your study, simply request that when you upload your revised preprint using the chat function.</p>
          <p>Thank you for the opportunity to review your interesting preprint.</p>

          <p>I’m a member of the launch team for <a href="http://www.sciencecolab.org/" target="_blank">Biophysics Colab</a>, a collaboration of biophysicists working in partnership with eLife to improve how research is evaluated. Later this year, we will launch a ‘publish, review, curate’ service that will support authors to create citeable, indexed versions of their work from published preprints. Until then, we are leveraging the knowledge and expertise of the global biophysics community to provide a <b>free preprint review service</b> that provides constructive, journal-agnostic feedback to authors.</p>
          <p>We are currently reviewing the preprint {{{ manuscriptTitleLink }}}, which the authors have revised in response to our earlier peer review report. You can access the report and the authors response by clicking on the title of the paper in our list of <a href="https://sciety.org/lists/ee7e738a-a1f1-465b-807c-132d273ca952" target="_blank">evaluated articles on Sciety</a>. Providing you have no potential conflicts of interest, we’re hoping you’ll be available to review the revised preprint for Biophysics Colab within the next two weeks. We would ask you to follow the guidelines below when formulating your feedback then participate in a discussion with the other reviewers to consolidate the various advice into a single report. With the authors’ permission, we will post this consolidated report on both bioRxiv and Sciety.</p>
          <p>We would not publish your individual report and your name would only be associated with the feedback if you agree to sign the consolidated report. However, we are encouraged that 96% of our reviewers have chosen to reveal their identities, as is evident in <a href="https://sciety.org/lists/ee7e738a-a1f1-465b-807c-132d273ca952" target="_blank">our public evaluations</a>. Please also bear in mind that the collaborative nature of peer review at Biophysics Colab would involve your identity being revealed to the other reviewers.</p>
          <p>Would you be able to review this revised preprint for Biophysics Colab? If so, please accept our invitation using the link below. If you need longer than two weeks, or have any questions about this request, please feel free to contact Lesley Anson (<a href="mailto:lesley@sciencecolab.org">lesley@sciencecolab.org</a>). If you’re unavailable, we’d be grateful if you let us know via the decline link, which will present a feedback field where you can suggest alternative reviewers such as postdoctoral scientists in your lab.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 2px;">Our primary goal is to deliver objective feedback on published preprints that is independent of the criteria applied by conventional journals. Our reports detail three types of recommendation: revisions that we consider to be essential for the results to support the conclusions; optional suggestions for the authors to consider; and minor corrections or presentational issues (see below). All these recommendations should help to strengthen the manuscript, but authors can decide which advice to follow. If a revised preprint addresses the revisions that we define as essential, we offer to publicly endorse the work. <br /> <br />

            <u>Recommendations</u>: <br />
