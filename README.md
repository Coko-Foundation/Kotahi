Kotahi is a modern submission, review and publishing system especially suited for academic journals, overlay journals, preprint curation groups, data publications, data review, research labs and PRC (publish-review-curate) groups. Kotahi supports:

- individual **research object submission**
- **bulk imports** of preprints and other documents/data objects for review
- **highly customisable** data and workflows
- **single source**, so that authors, editors, reviewers and production editors work on a single source without needing to send versions back and forth
- **automated export** to various formats including **JATS**, HTML, PDF
- integrations with DOAJ, Crossref, DataCite and more
- a built in, highly customisable **publishing site and CMS** (content management system)
- several **other publishing options** including **DOI registration**
- automated **citation management and structuring tools** via API lookups 
- a **task management** system to guide team-members, plus **in-app chat** and alerts to simplify communication
- **multitenancy**, allowing multiple groups to be hosted in a single instance, and allowing easy experimentation with new workflows
- a **plugin architecture** for custom functionality and easy extensibility
- modern interfaces, architecture, thinking
